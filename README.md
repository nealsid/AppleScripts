Apple Scripts I've written to help automate repetitive tasks

# Creating Envelopes & Letters from Addresses

The script takes a set of selected cells from Numbers and creates documents in Pages, 1 envelope and 1 letter per address.  It requires a specifically named template with 2 placeholders with certain tags in it for the envelope.  When you run the script, you choose an output folder and then it will read the spreadsheet and script Pages into creating and saving the documents.
